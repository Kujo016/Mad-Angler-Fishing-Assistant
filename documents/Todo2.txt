üéØ Goal
After gathering weather data with main.py, use the GPU (CUDA) to:

Load the CSV time-series weather file

Perform parallel processing across timestamps

For each timestamp:

Normalize the data (temp, pressure, humidity, wind)

Compute the chaos vector trajectory (volatility, spiral_speed, etc.)

Output a new tagged time-series showing the trajectory direction, quadrant classification, and intensity

üßÆ Step-by-Step Plan
Parse the CSV in C++

Read weather_data.csv into a std::vector of structs (WeatherPoint)

Each struct holds the required fields for that timestamp

Normalize Inputs Use the same normalization functions as in main.py:

cpp
Copy
Edit
humidity_norm = humidity / 100.0;
pressure_norm = pressure / 1013.25;
temp_norm = (temp_F - 32) / 68.0;
wind_norm = wind_speed / 15.0;
Pass to CUDA Kernel

Launch one thread per timestamp

Each thread computes:

volatility = norm_temp * (1.0 - norm_pressure) * norm_humidity

spiral_speed = norm_wind * norm_humidity

Trajectory vector = (volatility, spiral_speed)

Store Results

Return a vector of structs that include the timestamp and computed vector

Optionally map the result to your spiral quadrant system (a‚Äìh)

Output

Save or print:
date, time, volatility, spiral_speed, quadrant_label

üß† Concepts You‚Äôre Using
Data Normalization: Align different value ranges for fair comparison

Parallel Processing: Compute volatility and spiral across all timestamps simultaneously

Time-Series Vectorization: Derive weather ‚Äúmotion‚Äù in time

üõ† Tech Notes
Use thrust or raw CUDA for parallel loops

Consider using csv-parser C++ library for reading CSV easily

If needed, use pybind11 to call the CUDA-powered C++ from Python

‚úÖ Next Step
Start by building a C++ program that:

Reads the weather_data.csv

Normalizes the fields

Passes data to a CUDA kernel

Returns the volatility + spiral speed per timestamp

Then we can:

Expand into classification

Add spiral quadrant mapping

Use this to tag reports or generate plots
